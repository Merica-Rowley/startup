        <h2>How to Read Sheet Music:</h2>
        <p>Sheet music is typically rendered on a staff, which is comprised of five horizontal lines. Usually, notes are
            placed in one of two different clefts, treble and bass. The note's value depends on where it is located in
            the lines and spaces of the staff.</p>
        <p>There are various different methods for distinguishing between notes, however, for our purposes, we will use
            the letter naming system. That is, each note corresponds with either letter A, B, C, D, E, F, or G.</p>
        <p>On the treble cleft, the notes on the lines (from top to bottom) are E, G, B, D, and F. The notes on the
            spaces (from top to bottom) are F, A, C, and E.</p>
        <p>On the bass cleft, the notes on the lines (from top to bottom) are G, B, D, F, and A. The notes on the spaces
            (from top to bottom) are A, C, E, and G.</p>
        <p>Following the same alphabetical pattern, notes can be located further above or below the staff, as well.
            Ledger lines, spaced with the same distance as the horizontal lines on the staff, are used to mark how much
            higher or lower a note is, relative to the notes on the staff.</p>
